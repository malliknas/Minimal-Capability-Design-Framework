# Minimal-Capability-Design-Framework
Minimal Capability Design (MCD) framework for edge AI agents. MCD uses stateless, prompt-driven architectures with quantized models (Q1/Q4/Q8) rather than memory-heavy systems. Simulations and tests validate constraint-first design achieves sufficient performance for IoT deployment where traditional agents fail.
